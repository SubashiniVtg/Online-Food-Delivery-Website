🚀 Online Food Delivery Platform for Hostels 🍽️
I am excited to showcase my 4th-semester Database Management System project—an online food delivery platform tailored for hostels, offering a seamless e-commerce experience similar to Flipkart and Amazon.
This platform features:
User-friendly interface
Customer login
Restaurant manager login (managers can add/delete food based on availability)
Delivery boy login (for both in-house and external delivery personnel)
It's also highly responsive across devices, enhancing user accessibility.
As a beginner, it took me nearly 1.5 months to develop this project, utilizing frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP for the backend. I'm incredibly grateful to my DBMS Dr. Rajeswari A.M. and Internet Programming instructors Revathy JS for their guidance.
